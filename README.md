# Custom Enclosure Modifications for SV04 IDEX 3D Printer

### Printer Frame Dimensions
- **653mm x 625mm x 650mm** (29in x 29in x 28in)

This enclosure was modified from an original design to accommodate my larger printer. I documented the enclosure dimensions, wood and plexiglass resources in the US, and included build pictures, 3D files, and a bill of materials for wood and plexiglass cuts.

### Modifications

- **Frame Adjustment**: Increased frame size to fit the larger printer, using affordable wood square-end balusters.
  
- **Doors and Side Panels**: Used 3mm (1/8") pre-cut plexiglass sheets (36" x 24"). Larger sizes were special-order and costly, so I opted for easy-to-find sizes that only required one straight cut.

- **Gap Frame for Plexiglass**: Added 1/2"x1/2" square dowels to the frame for plexiglass support, as the sheets left a 1-inch gap in each window.

- **Resized Corner Connectors**: Enlarged connectors for the bigger frame, with front connectors modified to fit the door. Each corner slightly overlaps the frame, providing additional plexiglass support.

- **Plexiglass Attachment**: Used Liquid Nails for secure attachment; no clamps needed, and one tube was sufficient for all panels.

- **Lid Panel**: Used a 1/4" plexiglass sheet (30"x36") for the lid, which added stability. For cutting, I scored with a plexiglass knife and finished with a Dremel and diamond wheel, then polished with 400-grit sandpaper.

- **Lid Handles and Seal**: Added utility handles for easy lid removal and a rubber gasket for a better seal and to protect the wood.

- **Magnetic Door Closers**: Added cabinet magnets to keep the doors shut, plus a door sweep to seal the door gap if cuts aren't precise.

- **Utility Hinges**: Replaced 3D-printed hinges with affordable utility hinges and door knobs.

- **Enhanced LED Lighting**: Installed a full roll of LED strips along most edges for extra lighting.
